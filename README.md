# Graph-Neural-Network-based-Movie-Recommendation
Organizations within the entertainment industry, particularly streaming services, rely heavily on recommendation systems to enhance user experience and retain subscribers. These recommendation systems analyze vast amounts of user data to suggest movies tailored to individual preferences. Traditional recommendation methods often struggle to capture the intricate relationships between movies, leading to less accurate suggestions.

In this project, we explore the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) for movie recommendation systems. GNNs represent a paradigm shift in how recommendation systems understand and leverage the interconnected nature of movies. 

By treating movies and users as nodes within a complex network and capturing the relationships between them, GNNs offer a more accurate approach to movie recommendations.
